Introduction to DBMS
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that enables users to define, create, maintain, and manipulate databases. MySQL is a leading open-source relational DBMS that organizes data into tables with rows and columns, using Structured Query Language (SQL) for operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. Python, paired with the mysql-connector-python library, provides a powerful interface to interact with MySQL programmatically, enabling automation, data analysis, and application development.
This guide is a comprehensive resource that:

Covers all relational database concepts, from basics (tables, rows, columns) to advanced topics (replication, partitioning).
Provides Windows-specific instructions for setting up and running the project in VS Code’s Command Prompt terminal.
Includes detailed Python scripts for every DBMS operation, with error handling and best practices.
Demonstrates a school management system (school_db) with tables for students, courses, and related entities.
Offers advanced techniques for production environments, such as connection pooling and query optimization.


Project Objectives

If any step fails, refer to Troubleshooting.

DBMS Concepts and Implementation
This section covers every DBMS concept with exhaustive explanations and Python/MySQL code examples, tailored for Windows and VS Code’s Command Prompt.
Database Creation
A database is a container for tables. Create school_db.
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error

def create_database():
    try:
        # Connect to MySQL server
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host="localhost",
            user="root",
            password="MySecurePass123!"  # Replace with your root password
        )
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            # Create database
            cursor.execute("CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS school_db")
            print("Database 'school_db' created successfully!")
            # Verify database
            cursor.execute("SHOW DATABASES")
            databases = [db[0] for db in cursor.fetchall()]
            if "school_db" in databases:
                print("Confirmed: 'school_db' exists in MySQL.")
            else:
                print("Error: Database creation failed.")
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to MySQL: {e}")
    finally:
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()
            print("MySQL connection closed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_database()

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Import mysql.connector and Error for exception handling.
Define a function create_database() for modularity.
Connect to MySQL using host, user, and password.
Create a cursor to execute SQL commands.
Use CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS to avoid errors if school_db exists.
Verify creation with SHOW DATABASES.
Handle errors (e.g., wrong password, server not running).
Close resources to prevent memory leaks.
Save as scripts/create_database.py.
Run:python scripts/create_database.py



Table Creation
Tables store data in rows and columns. Create students and courses tables.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Create students table
    students_table_query = """
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        age INT CHECK (age >= 0 AND age <= 150),
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    )
    """
    cursor.execute(students_table_query)
    
    # Create courses table
    courses_table_query = """
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
        course_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        course_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        student_id INT,
        credits INT DEFAULT 3,
        FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
    )
    """
    cursor.execute(courses_table_query)
    
    print("Tables 'students' and 'courses' created successfully!")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
        print("MySQL connection closed.")

Explanation:

students Table:
id: Auto-incrementing primary key.
name: Non-null string (max 255 characters).
age: Integer with range check (0–150).
email: Unique, non-null string.
created_at: Timestamp for creation.
updated_at: Updates on record modification.


courses Table:
course_id: Primary key.
course_name: Non-null string.
student_id: Foreign key linking to students(id).
credits: Integer with default value 3.
ON DELETE CASCADE: Deletes courses if the student is deleted.
ON UPDATE CASCADE: Updates student_id if students.id changes.


Save as scripts/create_tables.py.
Run:python scripts/create_tables.py



CRUD Operations
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are the foundation of database interactions.
Create (Insert)
Insert single and multiple records into students.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Insert single student
    insert_single_query = """
    INSERT INTO students (name, age, email)
    VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
    """
    single_data = ("Alice Smith", 20, "alice.smith@email.com")
    cursor.execute(insert_single_query, single_data)
    connection.commit()
    print(f"Inserted {cursor.rowcount} student record.")
    
    # Insert multiple students
    insert_multiple_query = """
    INSERT INTO students (name, age, email)
    VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
    """
    multiple_data = [
        ("Bob Johnson", 22, "bob.j@email.com"),
        ("Carol White", 19, "carol.w@email.com"),
        ("David Lee", 21, "david.l@email.com")
    ]
    cursor.executemany(insert_multiple_query, multiple_data)
    connection.commit()
    print(f"Inserted {cursor.rowcount} student records.")
    
    # Insert course for a student
    insert_course_query = """
    INSERT INTO courses (course_name, student_id, credits)
    VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
    """
    course_data = ("Mathematics", 1, 4)
    cursor.execute(insert_course_query, course_data)
    connection.commit()
    print(f"Inserted {cursor.rowcount} course record.")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Explanation:

Use parameterized queries (%s) for security.
cursor.executemany() efficiently inserts multiple records.
connection.commit() saves changes.
Save as scripts/insert_data.py.
Run:python scripts/insert_data.py



Read (Select)
Retrieve data from students and courses.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor(dictionary=True)  # Return rows as dictionaries
    
    # Select all students
    cursor.execute("SELECT id, name, age, email, created_at FROM students")
    students = cursor.fetchall()
    print("All Students:")
    for student in students:
        print(f"ID: {student['id']}, Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}, "
              f"Email: {student['email']}, Created: {student['created_at']}")
    
    # Select with conditions
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT name, email
    FROM students
    WHERE age >= 20 AND created_at > '2025-01-01'
    ORDER BY name ASC
    """)
    filtered_students = cursor.fetchall()
    print("\nStudents Aged 20+ (Created After 2025):")
    for student in filtered_students:
        print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Email: {student['email']}")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Explanation:

dictionary=True: Returns rows as dictionaries for easier access.
Use WHERE, AND, ORDER BY for filtering and sorting.
Save as scripts/select_data.py.
Run:python scripts/select_data.py



Update
Update a student’s email and age.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Update email and age
    update_query = """
    UPDATE students
    SET email = %s, age = %s
    WHERE name = %s
    """
    data = ("alice.new@email.com", 21, "Alice Smith")
    cursor.execute(update_query, data)
    connection.commit()
    print(f"Updated {cursor.rowcount} student record(s).")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Explanation:

Use UPDATE with SET and WHERE.
Save as scripts/update_data.py.
Run:python scripts/update_data.py



Delete
Delete a student by email.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Delete student
    delete_query = "DELETE FROM students WHERE email = %s"
    data = ("alice.new@email.com",)
    cursor.execute(delete_query, data)
    connection.commit()
    print(f"Deleted {cursor.rowcount} student record(s).")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Explanation:

DELETE with WHERE ensures targeted deletion.
Save as scripts/delete_data.py.
Run:python scripts/delete_data.py



Primary and Foreign Keys

Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each record (e.g., id in students).
Foreign Key: Links tables (e.g., student_id in courses references students.id).

Example:

Already implemented in create_tables.py.
ON DELETE CASCADE: Deletes related courses if a student is deleted.
ON UPDATE CASCADE: Updates student_id if students.id changes.

Indexes
Indexes improve query performance for SELECT operations.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Create indexes
    cursor.execute("CREATE INDEX idx_email ON students (email)")
    cursor.execute("CREATE INDEX idx_name_age ON students (name, age)")
    print("Indexes created on 'email' and 'name,age' columns!")
    
    # Verify indexes
    cursor.execute("SHOW INDEXES FROM students")
    for index in cursor.fetchall():
        print(f"Index: {index[2]}, Column: {index[4]}")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Explanation:

Single-column index (idx_email) speeds up email-based queries.
Composite index (idx_name_age) optimizes queries involving both name and age.
Indexes may slow down INSERT/UPDATE due to index updates.
Save as scripts/create_indexes.py.
Run:python scripts/create_indexes.py



Joins
Joins combine data from multiple tables.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor(dictionary=True)
    
    # Insert sample data
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, age, email) VALUES ('Eve Brown', 20, 'eve.b@email.com')")
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO courses (course_name, student_id, credits) VALUES ('Physics', LAST_INSERT_ID(), 4)")
    connection.commit()
    
    # INNER JOIN
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT students.name, students.email, courses.course_name, courses.credits
    FROM students
    INNER JOIN courses ON students.id = courses.student_id
    """)
    print("INNER JOIN Results:")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(f"Name: {row['name']}, Email: {row['email']}, Course: {row['course_name']}, Credits: {row['credits']}")
    
    # LEFT JOIN
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
    FROM students
    LEFT JOIN courses ON students.id = courses.student_id
    """)
    print("\nLEFT JOIN Results:")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(f"Name: {row['name']}, Course: {row['course_name'] if row['course_name'] else 'None'}")
    
    # RIGHT JOIN
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
    FROM students
    RIGHT JOIN courses ON students.id = courses.student_id
    """)
    print("\nRIGHT JOIN Results:")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(f"Name: {row['name'] if row['name'] else 'None'}, Course: {row['course_name']}")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Join Types:

INNER JOIN: Only matching records from both tables.
LEFT JOIN: All students records, NULL for unmatched courses.
RIGHT JOIN: All courses records, NULL for unmatched students.
FULL JOIN: Not directly supported in MySQL; use UNION of LEFT and RIGHT joins.
Save as scripts/joins.py.
Run:python scripts/joins.py



Transactions
Transactions ensure data integrity by grouping operations.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    connection.autocommit = False  # Disable autocommit
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    try:
        # Insert student and course in a transaction

except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Explanation:

autocommit = False: Enables manual transaction control.
cursor.lastrowid: Gets the ID of the last inserted record.
commit(): Saves changes.
rollback(): Reverts on error.
Save as scripts/transactions.py.
Run:python scripts/transactions.py



Normalization
Normalization organizes data to eliminate redundancy and ensure integrity:

1NF (First Normal Form):
Atomic columns (no lists or sets).
Example: name is a single string, not a list of names.


2NF: 1NF + no partial dependencies.
Example: Separate courses table to avoid repeating student data.


3NF: 2NF + no transitive dependencies.
Example: Store student contact info in a separate contacts table if needed.



Example:

Unnormalized table: students (id, name, course1, course2).
Normalized:
students (id, name).
courses (course_id, course_name, student_id).



Stored Procedures
Stored procedures are reusable SQL scripts stored in the database.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Create stored procedure
    cursor.execute("""
    DELIMITER //
    CREATE PROCEDURE GetStudentDetails(IN studentId INT, OUT studentCount INT)
    BEGIN
        SELECT COUNT(*) INTO studentCount FROM students;
        SELECT id, name, age, email
        FROM students
        WHERE id = studentId;
    END //
    DELIMITER ;

Aggregations and Grouping
Perform calculations like COUNT, SUM, AVG.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor(dictionary=True)
    
    # Group by age with aggregations
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT age, COUNT(*) as student_count, AVG(age) as avg_age
    FROM students
    GROUP BY age
    HAVING student_count > 1
    ORDER BY age DESC
    """)
    print("Age Group Statistics:")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(f"Age: {row['age']}, Count: {row['student_count']}, Average Age: {row['avg_age']:.1f}")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Explanation:

GROUP BY: Groups by age.
HAVING: Filters groups with multiple students.
ORDER BY: Sorts results.
Save as scripts/aggregations.py.
Run:python scripts/aggregations.py



Subqueries
Subqueries are nested queries.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="MySecurePass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor(dictionary=True)
    
    # Students enrolled in Physics
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT name, email
    FROM students
    WHERE id IN (
        SELECT student_id
        FROM courses
        WHERE course_name = 'Physics'
    )
    """)
    print("Students Enrolled in Physics:")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(f"Name: {row['name']}, Email: {row['email']}")
    
    # Correlated subquery
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT name, email
    FROM students s
    WHERE EXISTS (

except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Explanation:

IN: Non-correlated subquery.
EXISTS: Correlated subquery for efficiency.
Save as scripts/subqueries.py.
Run:python scripts/subqueries.py



Constraints
Constraints enforce data integrity:

NOT NULL: Column must have a value (e.g., name).
UNIQUE: Values must be unique (e.g., email).
CHECK: Validates data (e.g., age >= 0).
FOREIGN KEY: Ensures referential integrity (e.g., student_id).
PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies records (e.g., id).
Already implemented in create_tables.py.

Error Handling in Python
Robust error handling is critical.
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import errorcode

try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="WrongPassword",  # Simulate error
        database="school_db"
    )
except mysql.connector.Error as e:
    if e.errno == errorcode.ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR:
        print("Authentication failed: Incorrect username or password.")
    elif e.errno == errorcode.ER_BAD_DB_ERROR:
        print("Database 'school_db' does not exist.")
    elif e.errno == errorcode.ER_HOST_NOT_PRIVILEGED:
        print("Host 'localhost' is not allowed to connect.")
    else:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
finally:
    if 'connection' in locals() and connection.is_connected():
        connection.close()
        print("MySQL connection closed.")

Explanation:

Use specific errorcode values for precise handling.
Check if connection exists before closing.
Save as scripts/error_handling.py.
Run:python scripts/error_handling.py



Database Security
Secure your database to prevent unauthorized access and attacks.

Strong Passwords:
Use complex passwords (e.g., MySecurePass123!).


Parameterized Queries:
Prevent SQL injection (used in all examples).


Least Privilege:
Create a dedicated user:CREATE USER 'school_app'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'AppPass123!';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE ON school_db.* TO 'school_app'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Save as sql/security.sql.
Run:mysql -u root -p < sql/security.sql




Encrypt Connections (Advanced):
Configure SSL in my.ini (not covered here).


Firewall:
Ensure port 3306 is not exposed externally unless needed.



Python Example (Using school_app user):
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="school_app",
        password="AppPass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 1")
    print(cursor.fetchone())
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()


Save as scripts/secure_connection.py.
Run:python scripts/secure_connection.py



Advanced Topics
Database Backup and Restore
Back up school_db using mysqldump.
mysqldump -u root -pMySecurePass123! school_db > backups/school_db_backup.sql


Creates school_db_backup.sql in the backups folder.

Restore:
mysql -u root -p school_db < backups/school_db_backup.sql

Python Backup Script:
import subprocess
import datetime
import os

def backup_database():
    try:
        os.makedirs("backups", exist_ok=True)
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
        backup_file = f"backups/school_db_backup_{timestamp}.sql"
        command = f"mysqldump -u root -pMySecurePass123! school_db > {backup_file}"
        subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True)
        print(f"Backup created: {backup_file}")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Backup failed: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    backup_database()


Save as scripts/backup.py.
Run:python scripts/backup.py



Connection Pooling
Connection pooling improves performance for multiple connections.
from mysql.connector.pooling import MySQLConnectionPool
from db_config import db_config

pool_config = {
    "pool_name": "school_pool",
    "pool_size": 5,  # Max 5 connections
    **db_config
}

try:
    connection_pool = MySQLConnectionPool(**pool_config)
    connection = connection_pool.get_connection()
    cursor = connection.cursor(dictionary=True)
    
    cursor.execute("SELECT name, email FROM students LIMIT 2")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(f"Name: {row['name']}, Email: {row['email']}")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Explanation:

pool_size: Limits concurrent connections.
Use db_config for credentials.
Save as scripts/connection_pool.py.
Run:python scripts/connection_pool.py



Query Optimization
Optimize queries for performance.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="school_app",
        password="AppPass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Analyze query
    cursor.execute("EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM students WHERE email = 'david.l@email.com'")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(row)
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

Optimization Tips:

Use Indexes: Already created on email.
Specific Columns: Avoid SELECT *.
EXPLAIN: Analyzes query execution plan.
Save as scripts/optimization.py.
Run:python scripts/optimization.py



User-Defined Functions (UDFs)
Create a function to categorize student age.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="school_app",
        password="AppPass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Create UDF
    cursor.execute("""
    DELIMITER //
    CREATE FUNCTION GetAgeCategory(age INT)
    RETURNS VARCHAR(20)
    DETERMINISTIC
    BEGIN
        DECLARE category VARCHAR(20);
        IF age < 18 THEN
            SET category = 'Minor';
        ELSEIF age <= 25 THEN
            SET category = 'Young Adult';
        ELSE
            SET category = 'Adult';
        END IF;
        RETURN category;
    END //
    DELIMITER ;
    """)
    
    # Use UDF
    cursor.execute("SELECT name, GetAgeCategory(age) AS age_category FROM students")
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(f"Name: {row[0]}, Age Category: {row[1]}")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()


Save as scripts/udf.py.
Run:python scripts/udf.py



Database Replication
Replication creates a copy of the database for redundancy or load balancing.

Configure Master (Localhost):

Edit my.ini (C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\my.ini):[mysqld]
server-id=1
log_bin=mysql-bin


Restart MySQL:net stop MySQL80
net start MySQL80


Create replication user:CREATE USER 'repl_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ReplPass123!';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;




Set Up Slave (Requires another MySQL instance; simplified here):

Install MySQL on another machine or use a different port.
Configure my.ini with server-id=2.
Run:CHANGE MASTER TO
    MASTER_HOST='localhost',
    MASTER_USER='repl_user',
    MASTER_PASSWORD='ReplPass123!',
    MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001',
    MASTER_LOG_POS=0;
START SLAVE;





Note: Replication setup is complex and requires additional hardware or virtual machines. This is a simplified overview.
Partitioning
Partition large tables to improve performance.
try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="school_app",
        password="AppPass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Create partitioned table
    cursor.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS student_log (
        log_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
        student_id INT,
        log_message VARCHAR(255),
        log_date DATE,
        PRIMARY KEY (log_id, log_date)
    )
    PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(log_date)) (
        PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
        PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2025),
        PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2026),
        PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
    )
    """)
    print("Partitioned table 'student_log' created!")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()

    # Search
    cursor.execute("""
    SELECT name, email
    FROM students
    WHERE MATCH(name) AGAINST('Alice' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
    """)
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(f"Name: {row[0]}, Email: {row[1]}")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    if connection.is_connected():

        user="school_app",
        password="AppPass123!",
        database="school_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor(buffered=True)  # Buffer results
    
    # Insert many records
    for i in range(1000):
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, age, email) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",
                       (f"Student_{i}", 18 + (i % 10), f"student{i}@email.com"))
    connection.commit()
    print("Inserted 1000 students.")
    
    # Fetch in batches
    cursor.execute("SELECT name, email FROM students")
    while True:
        rows = cursor.fetchmany(size=100)  # Fetch 100 rows at a time
        if not rows:
            break
        for row in rows:
            print(f"Name: {row[0]}, Email: {row[1]}")
except Error as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:

Running the Code on Windows

Clone the Repository:

Install Git for Windows from git-scm.com.
In VS Code terminal (Command Prompt):git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school_db_project.git
cd school_db_project




Create Project Structure:

Create folders:mkdir scripts sql backups logs


Save scripts as described above.


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Database:

Run:python scripts/create_database.py


Run SQL scripts:mysql -u root -p < sql/create_tables.sql
mysql -u root -p < sql/security.sql




Update db_config.py:

Edit db_config.py to use school_app user and AppPass123! password.


Run Scripts:

Individual scripts:python scripts/insert_data.py


Menu-driven program:python main.py




Test with MySQL Workbench:

Open MySQL Workbench.
Connect to localhost:3306 with root or school_app credentials.
Verify school_db, tables, and data.




Best Practices for DBMS Development

Code Organization:
Modularize scripts by function (e.g., insert_data.py).
Use db_config.py for credentials.


Security:
Never hardcode credentials.
Use environment variables (advanced):set DB_PASSWORD=AppPass123!

Access in Python:import os
password = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")




Performance:
Use indexes strategically.
Implement connection pooling for high-traffic apps.
Batch large inserts with executemany().


Error Handling:
Log errors to logs/app.log.
Handle specific MySQL error codes.


Backups:
Schedule backups using Windows Task Scheduler:
Create a batch file (backup.bat):@echo off
mysqldump -u root -pMySecurePass123! school_db > backups\school_db_backup_%date:~10,4%%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2%.sql


Schedule with Task Scheduler (search in Start menu).




Version Control:
Commit regularly:git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main


Use .gitignore for sensitive files.


Documentation:
Document SQL schemas in sql/ folder.
Comment Python code for clarity.




Troubleshooting Common Issues on Windows

MySQL Service Not Running:
Open Services:services.msc


Find MySQL80, right-click, select Start.
Or:net start MySQL80




Access Denied Error:
Verify credentials in db_config.py.
Reset root password:mysqladmin -u root -p password




pip Not Recognized:
Reinstall Python with Add Python to PATH checked.
Use:python -m pip install mysql-connector-python




Port 3306 Conflict:
Check port usage:netstat -aon | findstr :3306


Edit my.ini to change port (e.g., 3307):[mysqld]
port=3307


Update db_config.py:db_config["port"] = 3307




SQL Syntax Errors:
Test queries in MySQL Workbench:
Open Workbench, connect to localhost.
Run queries manually to debug.




VS Code Terminal Issues:
Ensure Command Prompt is default.
Restart VS Code after PATH changes.


Permission Errors:
Run VS Code as Administrator.
Use --user for pip:pip install mysql-connector-python --user




Slow Queries:
Use EXPLAIN to analyze.
Add indexes or optimize queries.


Backup Errors:
Ensure mysqldump is in PATH.
Check disk space in backups/ folder.
